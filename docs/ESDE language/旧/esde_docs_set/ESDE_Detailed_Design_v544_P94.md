## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What is ESDE?

ESDE (Existence Symmetry Dynamic Equilibrium) is an introspection engine that enables AI systems to observe their own cognitive patterns and autonomously adjust behavior when necessary.

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) lack three critical capabilities:

- **Self-awareness**: Cannot recognize their own response patterns
- **Rigidity detection**: Cannot identify when they are repeating the same answers
- **Autonomous adjustment**: Cannot modify behavior based on self-observation

ESDE addresses these limitations by providing an external observation structure that gives AI a form of pseudo-metacognition.

### 1.2 Core Architecture

ESDE operates through three integrated layers:

| Layer | Function | Analogy |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Foundation | 326 semantic atoms + connection dictionary | AI vocabulary and dictionary |
| Phase 7 | Unknown word detection, classification, resolution | Learning new words |
| Phase 8 | Thought pattern monitoring and adjustment | Self-reflection capability |
| Phase 9 | Statistical foundation for axis discovery | Pattern emergence detection |

### 1.3 Key Design Principles

ESDE is built on the following principles derived from Aruism philosophy:

- **Observation over judgment**: Detect uncertainty rather than assert confidence
- **Thresholds for computation, not truth**: Parameters control processing flow, not determine correctness
- **Ternary emergence**: Meaning manifests through three-term relationships, not binary oppositions
- **Symmetric duality**: Phase 7 (weak meaning) and Phase 8 (strong meaning) form a symmetric pair

---

## 2. Foundation Layer: Semantic Dictionary

### 2.1 Glossary: 326 Semantic Atoms

The foundation of ESDE is a set of 326 semantic atoms representing the minimal units of human conceptual space. These atoms are organized as 163 symmetric pairs.

#### 2.1.1 Design Principle: Existential Symmetry

Following Aruism's principle of existential symmetry, each concept exists in relation to its symmetric counterpart. Love cannot be defined without hate; life cannot be understood without death. This is not binary opposition but mutual definition.

```
EMO.love <-> EMO.hate     (Emotion pair)
EXS.life <-> EXS.death    (Existence pair)
ACT.create <-> ACT.destroy (Action pair)
VAL.truth <-> VAL.falsehood (Value pair)
```

#### 2.1.2 Atom Structure

Each semantic atom is defined by:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| ID | Unique identifier | aa_1 |
| Atom | Category.concept format | EMO.love |
| Definition | Precise semantic definition | Deep affection and care for another |
| Symmetric | Paired concept ID | aa_2 (EMO.hate) |

#### 2.1.3 Immutability Principle

The 326 atoms constitute the strongest meaning system and are immutable by design. Once defined, they do not change. This constraint ensures:

- **Stable observation axis**: Without a fixed reference frame, measurement becomes meaningless
- **Accumulation integrity**: Historical records remain interpretable across time
- **Cross-instance compatibility**: Different ESDE instances share a common semantic foundation

*Note: Phase 7 discoveries do NOT flow into Phase 8 glossary. The weak meaning system and strong meaning system remain structurally separate.*

### 2.2 Axes and Levels (10 Axes × 48 Levels)

Raw semantic atoms are too abstract for practical use. The axis-level coordinate system provides contextual precision.

#### 2.2.1 Ten Semantic Axes

| Axis | Question | Range |
|------|----------|-------|
| temporal | When? How long? | momentary → eternal |
| scale | What scope? | individual → cosmic |
| epistemological | How known? | perception → creation |
| ontological | What is it? | material → semantic |
| symmetry | How does it change? | destructive → cyclical |
| lawfulness | How constrained? | chaotic → deterministic |
| experience | How felt? | surface → profound |
| value_generation | What worth? | instrumental → intrinsic |
| interconnection | How connected? | isolated → universal |
| emergence | How arising? | latent → manifest |

#### 2.2.2 Mathematical Definition

Following ESDE v3.0 formalization:

```
Axis A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ}
F_axis = Σ λᵢ Ω(Xᵢ)
dA/dt = β G(X, A)
```

Where Ω represents the axis potential function and G represents the axis evolution function. Axis stability requires dF/dt ≤ 0.

### 2.3 Synapse: Connection Dictionary

Synapse bridges everyday language (WordNet synsets) to ESDE semantic atoms.

#### 2.3.1 Current Statistics

- 11,557 synsets registered
- 22,285 edges (synset → atom connections)
- Average connectivity: 1.93 edges per synset

#### 2.3.2 Connection Schema

```json
{
  "synset_id": "love.n.01",
  "target_atom": "EMO.love",
  "raw_score": 0.92,
  "axis": "interconnection",
  "level": "catalytic"
}
```

---

## 3. Phase 7: Unknown Resolution

### 3.1 Purpose: The Weak Meaning System

Phase 7 handles tokens that fall outside the established semantic space. It represents the weak meaning system - concepts that have not yet acquired stable semantic grounding.

In Aruism terms, Phase 7 deals with existences that are potential but not yet manifest. The system's task is not to force classification, but to observe and accumulate evidence until manifestation occurs naturally.

### 3.2 Four Hypothesis Routes

Unknown tokens are evaluated against four competing hypotheses:

| Route | Name | Criteria | Action |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| A | Typo | Edit distance ≤ 2 from known word | Suggest correction |
| B | Entity | Capitalized, proper noun pattern | External search (Wikipedia, etc.) |
| C | Novel | Valid morphology, no existing entry | Queue for Molecule generation |
| D | Noise | Invalid pattern, random characters | Discard |

### 3.3 Volatility: The Uncertainty Metric

Volatility measures how uncertain the system is about its classification:

```
V = 1 - (max_score - second_max_score)
```

| Status | Volatility | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Candidate | V < 0.3 | High confidence, proceed with classification |
| Deferred | 0.3 ≤ V ≤ 0.6 | Uncertain, accumulate more evidence |
| Quarantine | V > 0.6 | Very uncertain, requires human review |

### 3.4 Winner = Null Invariant

**Critical Design Constraint**: Phase 7 never declares a winner. The `winner` field must always remain `null`.

Rationale:
- Declaring winners is a Phase 8 function
- Phase 7 only provides evidence and hypotheses
- Forcing classification violates Aruism's observation-over-judgment principle

### 3.5 Evidence Collection (MultiSourceProvider)

External APIs provide evidence for Route B (Entity) hypothesis:

| Source | Type | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| Free Dictionary API | Dictionary | Primary definitions |
| Wikipedia API | Encyclopedia | Proper nouns, concepts |
| Datamuse API | WordNet | Related words |
| Urban Dictionary | Slang | Informal language |
| DuckDuckGo | Web Search | Final fallback |

**Performance**: 100% success rate, 49% Candidate rate, average volatility 0.177

---

## 4. Phase 8: Introspective Engine

### 4.1 Purpose: The Strong Meaning System

Phase 8 implements self-reflection by monitoring how concepts are being processed and detecting when patterns become rigid.

The 326 atoms represent the strong meaning system - stable reference points that enable observation. Unlike Phase 7's evolving weak meanings, Phase 8's atoms are fixed by design.

### 4.2 Rigidity: The Crystallization Metric

Rigidity measures how fixed a concept's processing pattern has become:

```
R = N_mode / N_total

Where:
  N_mode = occurrences of most frequent pattern
  N_total = total observations for this concept
```

| Range | Status | Strategy |
|-------|--------|----------|
| R < 0.3 | Volatile | STABILIZING (temp=0.0) |
| 0.3 ≤ R ≤ 0.9 | Healthy | NEUTRAL (temp=0.1) |
| R > 0.9 | Rigid | DISRUPTIVE (temp=0.7) |
| R ≥ 0.98 AND N ≥ 10 | Crystallized | ALERT triggered |

### 4.3 The Feedback Loop

```
Sensor → Generator → Ledger → Index → Modulator → (back to Generator)

1. Sensor extracts concept candidates from input text
2. Generator produces Molecules (atom + axis + level)
3. Ledger records the observation (immutable)
4. Index updates Rigidity calculations
5. Modulator adjusts generation strategy
```

### 4.4 Hash Chain Ledger (L1)

The Ledger maintains an immutable, tamper-evident history using SHA256 hash chains:

```python
entry_hash = SHA256(canonical_json(entry) + prev_hash)
```

**Genesis Entry**: First entry has `prev_hash = "0" * 64`

**Invariant**: Once written, entries cannot be modified. Corruption is detectable through hash chain verification.

### 4.5 Semantic Index (L2)

L2 is an in-memory projection of L1, optimized for Rigidity calculation:

- Rebuilt from L1 at startup (L1 is authoritative)
- Updated incrementally as new entries arrive
- Tracks: atom → {total_count, mode_count, direction_histogram}

### 4.6 Modulator Strategies

| Strategy | Condition | Temperature | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| NEUTRAL | 0.3 ≤ R ≤ 0.9 | 0.1 | Normal operation |
| DISRUPTIVE | R > 0.9 | 0.7 | Break rigid patterns |
| STABILIZING | R < 0.3 | 0.0 | Build consistency |

### 4.7 Crystallization Alert

When R ≥ 0.98 AND N ≥ 10, an alert is triggered:

```json
{
  "type": "crystallization_alert",
  "atom": "EMO.love",
  "rigidity": 0.985,
  "observations": 127,
  "message": "Concept requires attention - may need Reboot"
}
```

Alerts indicate the system has become too predictable and may require a Reboot (Phase 9).

## 5. Phase 9: Weak Axis Statistics Layer

### 5.1 Overview

Phase 9 implements the Weak Axis Statistics Layer, providing statistical foundation for axis discovery without human labeling. This layer bridges the gap between raw token analysis (Phase 7) and introspective meaning (Phase 8) by building statistical evidence for potential semantic axes.

### 5.2 W-Layer Architecture

The W-Layer architecture consists of six components that progressively build statistical understanding:

```
W0 (ContentGateway) → 外部データの正規化・取り込み
    ↓
W1 (Global Statistics) → 条件を無視した全体統計
    ↓
W2 (Conditional Statistics) → 条件別のスライス統計
    ↓
W3 (Axis Candidates) → 条件特異性スコア（S-Score）による軸候補抽出
    ↓
W4 (Structural Projection) → 記事をW3軸候補に投影、共鳴ベクトル生成
    ↓
W5 (Axis Confirmation) → 人間レビューによる軸確定（将来）
```

#### W0: ContentGateway

Normalizes external data into ArticleRecords with source_meta:
- `source_type`: news | dialog | paper | social | unknown
- `language_profile`: en | ja | mixed | unknown
- `time_bucket`: YYYY-MM format

#### W1: Global Statistics

Condition-blind token statistics via W1Aggregator:
- `total_count`: Total occurrences across all documents
- `document_frequency`: Number of documents containing the token
- `entropy`: Information-theoretic measure of token distribution

#### W2: Conditional Statistics

Token statistics sliced by condition factors via W2Aggregator:
- Per-condition token counts
- ConditionEntry denominators for probability calculation

#### W3: Axis Candidates

Per-token specificity analysis using S-Score formula:

```
S(t, C) = P(t|C) × log((P(t|C) + ε) / (P(t|G) + ε))

Where:
  P(t|C) = count_cond / total_cond
  P(t|G) = count_global / total_global
  ε = 1e-12 (fixed smoothing)
```

**Output**:
- `positive_candidates`: Tokens over-represented in condition (S > 0)
- `negative_candidates`: Tokens suppressed in condition (S < 0)

#### W4: Structural Projection (Phase 9-4)

**Theme**: The Resonance of Weakness (弱さの共鳴・構造射影)

Projects ArticleRecords onto W3 axis candidates to produce resonance vectors:

```
R(A, C) = Σ count(t, A) × S(t, C)

Where:
  A = Article
  C = Condition
  count(t, A) = Token count in article A
  S(t, C) = S-Score from W3 for token t under condition C
```

**Key Classes**:
- `W4Projector`: Projects articles onto W3 candidates
- `W4Record`: Per-article resonance vector

**W4Record Fields**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| article_id | str | Link to ArticleRecord |
| w4_analysis_id | str | Deterministic ID (SHA256) |
| resonance_vector | Dict[str, float] | Per-condition scores |
| used_w3 | Dict[str, str] | Traceability: cond_sig → w3_analysis_id |
| token_count | int | Total valid tokens (length bias awareness) |
| tokenizer_version | str | e.g., "hybrid_v1" |
| normalizer_version | str | e.g., "v9.1.0" |
| projection_norm | str | "raw" (v9.4: no normalization) |
| algorithm | str | "DotProduct-v1" |

**Example Output**:
```
News article: "The prime minister announced new government policy."
  → News resonance: +0.235
  → Dialog resonance: -0.130

Dialog article: "Hey! Yeah that's so cool lol."
  → News resonance: -0.095
  → Dialog resonance: +0.215
```

#### W5: Axis Confirmation (Planned)

Human review and axis labeling for future implementation.

### 5.3 Key Invariants

The W-Layer maintains strict invariants to ensure data integrity and auditability:

| Code | Layer | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| INV-W0-001 | W0 | ArticleRecord immutable after creation |
| INV-W2-003 | W2 | ConditionEntry denominators written by W2Aggregator only (W3 NEVER writes) |
| INV-W3-001 | W3 | W3 output is factual only, no axis labels |
| INV-W3-003 | W3 | Deterministic output (tie-break: token_norm ascending) |
| INV-W4-001 | W4 | No Labeling: output keys are condition_signature only |
| INV-W4-002 | W4 | Deterministic: same article + same W3 → same scores |
| INV-W4-003 | W4 | Recomputable: W4 = f(W0, W3) |
| INV-W4-004 | W4 | Full S-Score Usage: positive AND negative candidates |
| INV-W4-005 | W4 | Immutable Input: W4Projector does NOT modify inputs |
| INV-W4-006 | W4 | Tokenization Canon: MUST use W1Tokenizer + normalize_token |

### 5.4 Implementation Status

**Test Results**: Phase 9-0 ✓, Phase 9-1 (5/5) ✓, Phase 9-2 (5/5) ✓, Phase 9-3 (14/14) ✓, Phase 9-4 (11/11) ✓

All core components (W0-W4) have been implemented and tested. W5 (Axis Confirmation) remains planned for future implementation as it requires human-in-the-loop review processes.

## 6. System Architecture: Dual Symmetry

### 6.1 Phase 7 ↔ Phase 8 Symmetry

The relationship between Phase 7 and Phase 8 embodies the Aruism principle of existential symmetry. They are not sequential stages but symmetric systems observing different aspects of meaning.

| Aspect | Phase 7 (Weak Meaning) | Phase 8 (Strong Meaning) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Direction | External → ESDE | ESDE → ESDE |
| Target | Unknown tokens | Known concepts (326 atoms) |
| Question | What is this? | Am I biased? |
| Output | Classification hypothesis | Strategy selection |
| Uncertainty metric | Volatility | Rigidity |
| Ledger | evidence_ledger | semantic_ledger |
| Hash Chain | Not implemented | Implemented |

### 6.2 No Cross-Flow by Design

Phase 7 discoveries do NOT automatically flow into Phase 8. This is intentional:

- The 326 atoms constitute the immutable strong meaning system
- Phase 7 handles transient weak meanings that may never stabilize
- Mixing the two would compromise the observation axis

Long-term operation may reveal the need for controlled integration (via human audit), but this is a Phase 9+ concern.

### 6.3 Dual Symmetry (World_A / World_B)

Following ESDE v3.3 Dual Symmetry principle:

| Aspect | World_A (Our World) | World_B (Inverted) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Physical Laws | Fixed (high K) | Free (high ε) |
| Consciousness | Free (high ε) | Fixed (high K) |
| Discoverable | Physics | Mind |
| Mysterious | Mind | Physics |

World_A and World_B are not separate universes but the same existence viewed from different axes. In ESDE:

- Phase 7 = World of becoming (weak meanings seeking stability)
- Phase 8 = World of being (strong meanings requiring destabilization when rigid)

### 6.4 Component Overview

| Component | Layer | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Glossary | Foundation | Defines 326 semantic atoms |
| Synapse | Foundation | WordNet → Atom connection dictionary |
| Sensor | Phase 8 | Extracts concept candidates from text |
| Generator | Phase 8 | Produces Molecules via LLM |
| Ledger | Phase 8 | Immutable Hash Chain history (L1) |
| Index | Phase 8 | Rigidity calculation and tracking (L2) |
| Modulator | Phase 8 | Strategy selection |
| Pipeline | Phase 8 | Loop orchestration |
| W0-W4 | Phase 9 | Statistical axis discovery |
| Resolver | Phase 7 | Unknown token classification |
| Evidence Collector | Phase 7 | External API queries |

## 7. Philosophical Foundation: Aruism

### 7.1 Core Principle: Aru (There Is)

Aruism begins with the primordial recognition: There is. Before any definition, categorization, or judgment, existence simply is.

*Aru wa, aru. (There is, there is.)*

This is not a tautology but a foundational axiom. All subsequent understanding derives from this recognition.

### 7.2 The Seven Axioms

ESDE v3.0 formalizes Aruism through seven mathematical axioms:

| Axiom | Name | Statement | Mathematical Form |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0 | Aru | The primordial fact of existence | E = {x ∈ I \| L(x) < ∞} |
| E | Identification | Existence can be identified | E = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ} |
| L | Linkage | All existences are linked | L: E × E → [0,1] |
| Eq | Equality | All existences equal in status | F_being = Σ b(xᵢ) |
| C | Creativity | Creativity orthogonal to gradient | C ⊥ ∇F |
| ε | Error | Error always exists | E = f(I) + ε, ε ≠ 0 |
| T | Ternary | Manifestation requires three terms | A↔B↔C ⇒ Manifest |

### 7.3 Axiom T: Ternary Emergence

The most significant extension in ESDE v3.3 is Axiom T: manifestation requires ternary structure.

#### 7.3.1 Insufficiency of Binary Relations

Consider:
- One entity: No comparison possible
- Two entities: Change exists but is not observed
- Three entities: Change is observed → Time manifests

The third term C serves as observer, enabling the A↔B relationship to become manifest rather than remaining latent.

#### 7.3.2 Formal Statement

```
A ↔ B : Latent (potential, not manifest)
A ↔ B ↔ C : Manifest (observable, structured)

P(Manifest | L_binary) < P(Manifest | L_ternary)
where L_ternary = L(A,B) ∧ L(B,C) ∧ L(C,A)
```

#### 7.3.3 ESDE Implementation

In ESDE, ternary structure manifests as:

```
Sensor (A) ↔ Generator (B) ↔ Ledger/Index (C) ⇒ Meaning
```

The Ledger serves as the third observer that causes semantic processing to become manifest (recorded, trackable, adjustable).

### 7.4 Emergence Directionality

ESDE v3.3.1 extends Axiom T by formalizing that emergence has direction:

#### 7.4.1 Creative Emergence (=>+)

- Connectivity increases (L↑)
- Structure complexity increases
- Persistence increases
- Hierarchy deepens

#### 7.4.2 Destructive Emergence (-|>)

- Connectivity decreases (L↓)
- Existing structures dissolve
- Rigidity breaks (ε↑)
- Space opens for new patterns

#### 7.4.3 The Rigidity-Destruction Cycle

```
L↑ sustained → ε↓ (rigidity increases)
ε↓ beyond threshold → System becomes brittle
Brittle system + perturbation → -|> (Reboot)
Post-Reboot: ε↑, space for new =>+ (creative emergence)
```

*Destruction is not failure but preparation for new creation.*

### 7.5 Dynamic Equilibrium

The fundamental stability condition of ESDE:

```
ε × L ≈ K_sys
```

Where:
- ε = Error/flexibility factor
- L = Linkage strength
- K_sys = System constant

This equation states that flexibility and connectivity must balance. High connectivity (rigid structure) requires low flexibility, and vice versa. Violation of this equilibrium triggers corrective emergence.

---

## 8. Mathematical Formalization

### 8.1 Integrated Potential Function

Following ESDE v3.0, the system state is governed by:

```
F = F_being + F_link + F_axis

Where:
  F_being = Σᵢ b(xᵢ)           (existence weight)
  F_link = ½ Σᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ φ(xᵢ,xⱼ)  (interaction)
  F_axis = Σₖ λₖ Ω(Xₖ)         (axis structure)
```

### 8.2 State Evolution

System dynamics follow gradient descent with creativity injection:

```
dx/dt = -α ∇F + γ C(X, A)

Where:
  α = linkage coefficient
  γ = creativity coefficient
  C = creativity vector (C ⊥ ∇F)
```

### 8.3 Equilibrium Conditions

Dynamic equilibrium is achieved when:

```
dX/dt = 0, dA/dt = 0
Or stable on invariant manifold M.
```

### 8.4 Entropy Interpretation

Setting S = -F:

```
dS/dt = Σᵢ αᵢ ||∇F||² + β⟨∇F, G⟩ ≥ 0
```

The system always evolves toward entropy increase (dynamic equilibrium). This formalizes the Aruism principle that existence tends toward linked harmony.

### 8.5 Hierarchy Function

Linkage strength depends on hierarchical distance:

```
wᵢⱼ = g(|h(i) - h(j)|)
Where h(i) = hierarchy level of existence i
```

However, axis-mediated linkage (Global Broadcast) is hierarchy-independent.

### 8.6 Implementation Simplification

For practical implementation (e.g., local LLM processing):

```
State: x = (p, n)  # current position, target
Potential: F = |p - n|² + linkage + axis
Normal: dp/dt = -α∇F
Creative: dp/dt = γC where C⊥∇F and C·(n-p) > 0
```

### 9.2 Future Phase: Reboot and Integration

#### 9.2.1 Future Phase-A: Reboot Implementation

When a concept reaches crystallization (R ≥ 0.98, N ≥ 10), automatic reconstruction is triggered:

- Clear accumulated patterns for the crystallized concept
- Inject destructive emergence (-|>) to break rigidity
- Allow new creative emergence (=>+) to form fresh patterns

This implements the Rigidity-Destruction Cycle from ESDE v3.3.1.

#### 9.2.2 Future Phase-B: Energy Function

Implement the full potential function F = F_being + F_link + F_axis with:

- Real-time energy calculation
- Gradient visualization
- Equilibrium monitoring

#### 9.2.3 Future Phase-C: Web UI

Browser-based visualization dashboard showing:

- Live Rigidity map across all atoms
- Emergence direction flow
- Ledger integrity status
- Strategy history

### 9.3 Phase 7 ↔ Phase 8 Integration

Currently independent systems with potential integration points:

| Integration | Trigger | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 7→8 | New Patch applied | Update Index with new connections |
| 8→7 | Reboot triggered | Re-evaluate quarantined tokens |
| Common Ledger | Design decision | Unified format for both systems |

*Note: Integration must preserve the structural separation between weak and strong meaning systems.*

### 9.4 Phase 10: Multi-Instance

Multiple ESDE instances operating in parallel:

- Knowledge sharing protocols
- Distributed ledger consensus
- Collective emergence detection

#### D.6 Data Flow Dependencies

Critical file dependencies that must be preserved:

**Phase 7 Flow:**
```
Input Text → engine.py → extractors.py → collectors.py → routing.py
→ queue.py → resolver/* → evidence_ledger_7bplus.jsonl
```

**Phase 8 Flow:**
```
Input Text → sensor/molecule_generator_live.py → sensor/validator_v83.py
→ ledger/persistent_ledger.py → index/semantic_index.py
→ index/rigidity.py → feedback/modulator.py
→ pipeline/core_pipeline.py (orchestration)
```

**Phase 9 Flow:**
```
External Data → integration/gateway.py (W0) → ArticleRecord
→ statistics/w1_aggregator.py (W1) → W1Record
→ statistics/w2_aggregator.py (W2) → W2Record
→ statistics/w3_calculator.py (W3) → W3Record
→ statistics/w4_projector.py (W4) → W4Record (resonance_vector)
```

**Shared Resources:**
- esde_dictionary.json (Glossary) - used by all phases
- esde_synapses_v3.json (Synapse) - used by all phases
